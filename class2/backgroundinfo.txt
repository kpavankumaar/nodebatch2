compiler : takes the source code and turn it into an excutable code 

transpiler : takes source code and convert that into another source code 
eg : LESS and SASS - > css 
coffeescript -> javascript

interpreters : take sourcecode and excute it by themselves 
v8engine  : interperter 
v8 compiles the code at runtime and make it faster 
a. Javascript Core (ios- safari)
b. spidermonkey (Firefox)
c. Chakra (Internet explorer)

NOde js is a serverside javascript runtime environmet
Node is C++ application embeded with v8 Engine

Node has two primary based programs . 
both of these programs get called from command line.
a. REPL 
b. Script Processor 

scriptprocessor : 
    a. initialize process called as eventloop
    b. process the initial parts of the javascript file 

then start the processing of event loop that it has initialized earlier
what is an event loop

event loop is nothing but infinitely repeating task (it means that it starts over as soon as it just completes)

scriptprocessor can handle code in two ways 
a .synchronous behaviour, b. asynchronous behaviour
synchronous behaviour code is invoked and are immediately completed 
asynchronous behaviour are invoked and are not immediately completed , these behaviours are added to the event queue

event loop is a way of the processing the todolist.
with each tick of the loop it completes an item or several items on the list 

items that are added to todolist
items in todolist are ones which are not executed asyncronously
eg: invoke a callback , timeouts 

these are called as umbrella of tasks which are non blocking
