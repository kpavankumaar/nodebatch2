You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank

req- activates the part of openssl that deals with certificate requesting signing
newkey - generate  a new private key 
new - generate new request 
no des - means that we dont want the generated private key to be encrypted

RSA is one of the first public key cryptosystems and it is widely used for secure data transimission
RSA - 2048 this is key size 

keyout key.pem - store the priave key in a file called as key.pem 

-out cert.pem - store the certificate in a file called as cert.pem 
rsa alogrithm is used to encrypt data and is decrypted on the recieving data 
public key and private key , public key is given to users and private key is  kept secret

the encrypted data from the user is prepared by public key and this encrypted data is decrypted by using the private key
public key and piravte key can encrypt and decrypt data
